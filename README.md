# PAWLATRO

A furry mod for the hit game-of-the-year-nominee Balatro! Currently adds 7 different jokers and a new poker hand to the game themed around fandom references and jokes. Much more is planned on future versions!

### How to install

This mod requires Steammodded to work, if you don't know what that is I recommend [watching this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY2LnRYWm5Y) which explains how to download it and any Balatro mod you may wish to.
